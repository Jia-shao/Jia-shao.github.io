Hi, I am a final-year undergraduate student at the Artificial Intelligence Lab of Southern University of Science and Technology, under the supervision of Professor Zhihai He (IEEE Fellow). I also spent an impressive summer in 2024 at Stanford University, where I deepened my understanding of algorithms and optimizations.

My research is focused on image generation, and its practical applications, including image coding and image super-resolution. I am also interested in developing efficient image generation models that offer faster speed and higher quality. My goal is to address key challenges in the image generation process, thereby improving the performance of downstream tasks that are based on generation methods.

Currently, I am seeking PhD opportunities to further explore the key issues in image generation technology. I aim to develop advanced algorithms that can significantly enhance the quality and speed of image generation, and I am eager to apply these techniques to real-world scenarios to make a positive impact.
